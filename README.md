## Structure: Docker services
### Django
Django, Django Rest Framework (DRF), and GeoDjango are used together to build web applications that require geospatial data processing and API development.

Django is a popular web framework for building Python-based web applications. It provides a lot of built-in features, such as an ORM for database interactions, a templating engine, and a powerful admin interface, which can speed up development time.

DRF is a Django package that provides tools for building RESTful APIs. It extends Django's built-in views and serializers to provide a more flexible and powerful way of building APIs. DRF is widely used to build APIs for web and mobile applications.

GeoDjango is a Django package that adds support for geospatial data processing to Django. It allows developers to store, retrieve, and process geospatial data in the context of a Django application. GeoDjango provides many GIS-related tools, such as spatial indexing, geographic data models, and geospatial functions.

By combining Django, DRF, and GeoDjango, developers can build web applications that can store, process, and serve geospatial data through RESTful APIs. This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as mapping services, location-based services, and data visualization tools that require geospatial data processing.

In this application, Django framework and packages are used to:

- provide REST APIs to the frontend
- scan NetCDF files provided by Thredds and handle the attributes of climate projection models.

Root directory: `backend`

#### PostGIS
PostGIS is a spatial database extender for the PostgreSQL relational database management system. It allows you to store, query, and manipulate spatial data such as points, lines, and polygons, as well as geospatial data formats such as GeoJSON and KML. PostGIS adds support for geographic objects, allowing spatial queries to be run in SQL. It provides a wide range of spatial functions and operators for performing geometric operations such as intersection, union, and buffering, as well as distance calculations and projections. PostGIS is widely used in geographic information systems (GIS), web mapping applications, and other spatially enabled applications. It is an open-source project and is actively developed and maintained by a community of developers around the world.

In this application, PostGIS is used to query all available climate projections, manage administrative users, and geographic locations.

#### Nginx
Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server. It is designed to handle large amounts of traffic and to act as a load balancer for web applications. Nginx can serve static files quickly and efficiently, and also supports dynamic content generated by backend applications such as PHP, Python, and Node.js. In addition to its role as a web server, Nginx can also be used as a reverse proxy, which allows it to distribute incoming traffic among multiple backend servers, improve the reliability and scalability of web applications, and provide additional security features such as SSL/TLS encryption and HTTP authentication. Nginx is free and open-source software, and its development is supported by Nginx, Inc. and a community of developers around the world.

In this application, Nginx is used as a proxy-pass for other web services.

Config directory: `docker/nginx`

#### NodeJS (proxy Thredds Data Server)
A NodeJs server-side proxy application can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as load balancing, caching, and security filtering. For example, a load-balancing proxy can distribute incoming requests among multiple backend servers, improving the scalability and availability of web applications. A caching proxy can store frequently accessed data in memory or on disk, reducing the load on backend servers and improving the performance of web applications. A security filtering proxy can inspect incoming requests and filter out potentially harmful requests or data, protecting web applications from attacks. Node.js is a popular platform for building proxy servers due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle large numbers of concurrent connections efficiently,

In this application it acts as an intermediary between clients and Thredds Data Server servers, allowing users to access a subset of THREDDS data and services without authentication. It receives requests from clients and forwards them to Thredds Data Server, and then sends the response back to the client. 

Root directory: `backend`

#### Martin
Martin Vector Tile Server is an open-source vector tile server that allows users to serve vector tiles over the web. It is built for MapLibre, an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps, and supports a variety of data sources, including GeoJSON, PostGIS, and Shapefile. 

## PRODUCTION USAGE

#### Clean build & start containers

    ```shell
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose up -d
    ```    

#### Build images & start containers:

    `docker-compose up --build -d`


#### Make django migrations: 

    `docker exec -ti backend.api python manage.py makemigrations users groups forecastattributes places thredds`


#### Migrate database:

    `docker exec -ti backend.api python manage.py migrate`


#### Create a Super User to access the Django Admin interface:

    `docker exec -ti backend.api python manage.py createsuperuser`

    NOTE: prompt for username, email, password


#### To create base layer attributes as Variables, Forecast models, Scenario e etc. Run:

    `docker exec -ti backend.api python manage.py import_attributes`


#### To collect all Municipalities (from the geojson) and define geographical boundaries:

     `docker exec -ti backend.api python manage.py import_regions`


#### Scanning selected Threeds folders and copying metadata:

    `docker exec -ti backend.api python manage.py import_layers`

    NOTES:
    - to update already imported layers, run the command with the `--refresh` flag
    - to fully clean layers and & re-import them, run the command with the `--destroy` flag


#### Stop & destroy containers (note using `-v` will remove the volumes)

    `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down`

#### SSL certificates

SSL certificate are mounted in the nginx container as a volume. The certificate files and the private key should be placed in the folder listed on .env file (NGINX_SSL_CERTS_PATH) and named as specified in .env file `SSL_CERTIFICATE` and `SSL_KEY`, note that certificate needs to be bundled with the full chain.

# Development

GIT BRANCH: `develop`

#### Required tools for development

For development on your local machine, you need to install the following tools:
   - git
   - docker
   - docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml
   - a text editor or an IDE (Eg. Visual Studio Code)


#### Prepare the Environment
    
    Starting from the root of the project, clone the backend repository, move on `develop` branch and clone frontend repository inside this project

    
    git clone https://github.com/inkode-it/Arpav-PPCV-backend
    cd Arpav-PPCV-backend
    git checkout develop
    git clone https://github.com/inkode-it/Arpav-PPCV

#### Copy `.env.example` in `.env` and **customize it with your local settings** both for the backend and the frontend.

    NOTE: `.env`'s file are used to set the environment variables for the docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml file and the running services, to configure the backend and frontend services, the PostGIS database, Nginx web server etc..


#### For Frontend `Arpav-PPCV`, follow the instructions in the *frontend README.md file to start the frontend*
